# Jebel
Jebel is a comunications systems that utilizes the long range abilities of the Lora spread spectrum modulation scheme developed by Semtech. It is an sms based comunication system designed to work where there is no functioning communication system, or where the communication system has failed. The programming is done in the Arduino IDE so it can ported to multiple micro controllers. The system is composed of user nodes and solar powered repeaters that can be set at strategic locations to create a network to connect people and sensors.

Note August 24th: Arduino files in very early stage of development. May be useful for someone as a jumping off point, but still considerable development work underway.
